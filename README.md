## Bloodhound

Bloodhound is a Sinatra app that allows you to view all of a user's Tumblr asks easily.

Currently there is no way to do this natively on Tumblr, as there is no 'ask' filter. Bloodhound solves this problem.

A live version of the app can be found [here](link_to_heroku).

## Configuring the app

In order to get Bloodhound running, you need to modify the YAML file in the config/ directory and enter your Tumblr consumer key.

You can request a Tumblr consumer key [here](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)
