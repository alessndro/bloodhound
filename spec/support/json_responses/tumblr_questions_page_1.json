I have a few questions regarding some changes with the ask box function:  1) Why has tumblr eliminated the ability to hit \u0027enter\u0027 in ask boxes? and 2) Why are there character limits in asks? Ask messages are one of the main ways tumblr users communicate with each other. It\u0027s seems like the website is actively reducing functionality and communication b\/w its users.","answer":"We\u2019ve been gradually tightening the Ask feature to eventually ensure real questions are all that make it through. In addition to keeping out spam and junk, we\u2019re doing this in preparation for some new feedback tools that are about to roll out. This is increasingly important as the current Ask feature was not designed for high-volume communication and is becoming problematic to scale.\n\nWhile I promise the new features will be some of the greatest we\u2019ve built, I must stress that we have no plans to make Tumblr a replacement for email.
